# BONELORD

![image](Assets\Sprites\UI\title_image.png)

A game for the Zer0 Game Jam at Universidade Lusófona. The theme was "Bones".

In Bonelord, you control a necromancer that can summon skeletons to fight waves of self-righteous clerics.

Gather resources and build custom skeletons from scratch!

This was my entry for the "Zero Game Jam" at Lusófona University, and is very incomplete. Basically I built the whole game in 20 hours or so.

Full source code can be found at https://github.com/DiogoDeAndrade/BoneLord

I was having a lot of fun with this one, and I believe it can actually be fun, so I may develop this further in the future.

## Instructions

* Left-Click on the necromancer to see your inventory.
* Left-Click on the goblin or any player controlled character to select it
* Right-Click with a selected unit to make it walk there
* Some units are cowards, i.e., they will actively run away from enemies
* Goblins can pickup items from the playfield
* Items can be used to create skeletons
* Click the summoning circle to summon a skeleton
* You need to select the ingredients for the summon
* Different ingredients do different things
* Rules:
* At least one bone must be used in the skeleton
* Only one tool can be used (only one tool in the game at the moment, the pickaxe)
* The rest find out what they do...
* Skeletons with a mining pick can mine ore nodes and get more (and rarer) items
* From time to time, some cleric will appear and walk towards the necromancer
* When they get there, they will attack him and if they kill him it's game over
* The game doesn't have an end, it's just going forever until you inevitably lose

## Future

There are a lot of ideas for future here, just keeping them here as a kind of to do list:

* Impact effects
* Sounds
* Ranged attacks
* Melee AOE attack (single, ranged and targetted)
* Melee and ranged attack defs
  * So we can customize the properties without using hardcoded values
* Add "coward" as an effect for some items
* Item combinations to change name/color/properties
* Shop
  * Buy items
  * Hire units
    * Units like goblins and mercenary units have an upkeep
  * Sell items
* Gold system
* Treasure chests and containers in the environment
* Better environment
  * Fog of war
  * Pathfinding
* Summon sickness
  * Summoned units take a bit to be at full power
* Spellbook
  * Items can only be used after being researched (with a cost in souls)
* Other tools
  * Axe to cut trees
  * Lockpicks to open closed doors
  * Sword to improve attack
  * Shield is an idea to improve defense (not implemented yet), but it clashes with the idea of only one tool
* Cauldron
  * Enables creating better items to improve summoning
